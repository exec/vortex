# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security at Vortex

Security is fundamental to Vortex's design. Unlike container platforms that share the host kernel, Vortex provides true hardware-level isolation through VM technology, making it inherently more secure than Docker-based solutions.

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Hardware-Level Isolation
- **True VM Boundaries**: Each environment runs in a separate VM with dedicated kernel
- **No Shared Kernel**: Eliminates container escape vulnerabilities
- **Hardware Enforcement**: CPU-level security features protect host system
- **Process Isolation**: Complete separation from host processes

### Threat Protection
- **Container Escape**: **Impossible** - VMs have hardware boundaries
- **Privilege Escalation**: **Mitigated** - Isolated kernel space
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: **Contained** - Malicious code trapped in VM
- **Kernel Exploits**: **Isolated** - Host kernel remains protected

## 🔍 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 0.3.x   | ✅ Yes            | Current stable release |
| 0.2.x   | ⚠️ Limited        | Security fixes only |
| < 0.2   | ❌ No             | End of life |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### How to Report
**⚠️ DO NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities**

Instead, please email security reports to:
- **Email**: `security@vortex-project.org` (if available)
- **GitHub**: Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/exec/vortex/security/advisories)
- **Alternative**: Create a draft security advisory on GitHub

### What to Include
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security implications
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: OS, version, and configuration details
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for resolution

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly during investigation
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Verify Downloads**: Check checksums for binary releases
- **Limit Access**: Use principle of least privilege
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch for unusual VM behavior

### For Developers
- **Dependency Auditing**: Run `cargo audit` regularly
- **No Unsafe Code**: Avoid `unsafe` blocks without justification
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Resource Limits**: Implement bounds checking

## 🛠️ Security Tools & Automation

### Continuous Security Monitoring
- **Cargo Audit**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot alerts for vulnerable dependencies
- **CI/CD Integration**: Security checks in every build
- **Code Scanning**: Static analysis for security issues

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Check for unsafe code
grep -r "unsafe" src/ --include="*.rs"

# Dependency security scan
cargo audit --db https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db
```

## 🔒 Hardening Guidelines

### System Security
- **VM Configuration**: Use minimal base images
- **Network Isolation**: Restrict unnecessary network access
- **File Permissions**: Apply principle of least privilege
- **Resource Limits**: Configure CPU and memory bounds

### Development Security
- **Secure Defaults**: All templates use security-first configurations
- **Dependency Management**: Pin versions and audit regularly
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to repositories
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms

## 📊 Security Metrics

### Current Security Status
- ✅ **Zero Known Vulnerabilities**: All dependencies clean
- ✅ **No Unsafe Code**: Pure safe Rust implementation
- ✅ **Automated Scanning**: CI/CD security validation
- ✅ **Hardware Isolation**: True VM boundaries

### Security Targets
- **Response Time**: < 48 hours for critical issues
- **Patch Deployment**: < 7 days for security fixes
- **Vulnerability Window**: Minimize exposure time
- **Zero Day Protection**: Hardware isolation limits impact

## 🔮 Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Formal Security Audit**: Third-party security assessment
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Community-driven vulnerability discovery
- **Security Documentation**: Detailed security guides
