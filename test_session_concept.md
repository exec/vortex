# Simplified Session Management Concept

Your insight was spot-on! Instead of a complex daemon, we now have a much cleaner approach:

## ðŸ”¥ The New Workflow

```bash
# Create a detached Python development environment
vortex dev python --name myproject --detach

# This creates a background VM process that keeps running
# The VM ID becomes "vortex-myproject" for easy identification

# List running background VMs (like docker ps)
vortex sessions

# Attach to the running VM (like docker exec)
vortex attach vortex-myproject

# Or use the short name if you provided one
vortex attach myproject

# Stop the background VM
vortex stop vortex-myproject
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Achieves

1. **No Daemon Complexity**: VMs just run as background processes
2. **Natural Process Model**: Like `nohup` or `screen` but for VMs
3. **Easy Discovery**: `vortex sessions` shows running background VMs
4. **Simple Attach**: Connect to any running VM instantly
5. **Named Sessions**: User-friendly identifiers

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

- **Detached Mode**: `--detach` flag makes VM run in background
- **Named VMs**: `--name` creates `vortex-{name}` for easy identification  
- **Session Discovery**: Uses existing `vm_manager.list()` to find running VMs
- **Attach Logic**: Enhanced `vm_manager.attach()` can connect to any discovered VM
- **No State Files**: Relies on actual running VM processes

## ðŸ“Š Comparison

**Before (Complex):**
```
User â†’ Daemon â†’ Session Manager â†’ VM Manager â†’ krunvm
```

**After (Simple):**
```
User â†’ VM Manager â†’ krunvm (background process)
```

This is exactly what you envisioned - turning VMs into persistent background processes that you can attach to at will, just like screen sessions but for entire development environments!

## ðŸ§ª Example Usage

```bash
# Start a persistent Python environment
vortex dev python --name ai-project --detach --volume ./code:/workspace

# Later, from anywhere...
vortex attach ai-project

# Or see what's running
vortex sessions
```

The VM becomes a long-running "daemon" of sorts, but it's just a regular background process managed by krunvm, not a separate daemon service.
